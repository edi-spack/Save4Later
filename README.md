# Save4Later

Save4Later is a note-taking web app. The idea behind it was to be able to quickly log in by scanning a QR code with the smartphone on which you are already logged in. Unfortunately the mobile app is not yet implemented, only logging in with credentials works at the moment.

A live demo is available here: [https://save4later.edispack.cc/](https://save4later.edispack.cc/).
